<h2>My project idea</h2>
<p><b><big>Nowadays, technological and scientific progress reached a huge success, and its pace will keep constantly increasing. The main reason for development and progress is the desire of humans to live comfortably. In addition, there are many inventions that can help people live more conveniently such as smartphones not only can use for communication but also can help people entertaining also study...etc. There are more and more technologies out there that have been invented. However, for me the technology that can elevate your house to a new level makes me interested the most which people called a smart home. My project idea is about I will create a program or an app or a function that will control and optimization all of the appliances in your house to be useful, smart, and saving energy. And finally, all of that combine to be a smart house.  </p></b></big>
<p><b><big> So first we need to know what is a smart house and why I'm interested in this project. A smart house is a house that has highly advanced automatic systems for lighting, temperature control, fire alarm security, water appliances, and many other functions. Signals are sent through the home’s wiring to switches and outlets that are programmed to operate appliances and electronic devices in every part of the house. That why a smart home promises a huge number of possibilities for our future way of life. My motivation that I want to create an interest in this project is because it makes our life more convenient and it helps a lot of people in their daily life. Also, this project aim can support many elderly people with many basic duties thing in the house that have been already automated and their children will feel less worried about them thanks to the convenience and safety of this project.    </p></b></big>
<p><b><big> In the first and second paragraphs, we have already known what is a smart house, so now I will focus more on how this app or the function I put in the appliances can elevate the house. To begin,the name i wIll choose for this app is T-home and the T letter stand for technology. Since the aim of this apps is to make your living more comfortable,safety and reserved more energy in your house.</p></b></big>
<p><b><big> Let come to its first function which is lighting control. The problem of huge amount of light switches in smart house is reduced thanks to the flexibility of the apps also the switches. Since right now, you can just use the app to control which light you want to turn on or turn off. Furthermore, all of the switches can also be reprogrammed to turn on or turn off by your voice have been registered and recognized in the app. This function is quite the same as Siri in iPhone. However, instead of applied it to control your phone this smart technology can control the system of your house. In addition, you can also edit your individual light scenario for each group of light devices. For example, there may be some different modes like reading, housework, working and could have some outdoor mode. This sounds very crazy but maybe it can even change to the color you want. The last part that i really like about it is the app that connected to the light can simultaneously estimate the amount of natural light to the house. Then it gives you some advice about how bright the light should be appropriate. And if you change the function to automatic mode it will self-changing for you. For example, in the morning "T-home" will automatically turn off the light and vice versa smart house will increase the intensity of light in proportion to the daylight.    </p></b></big>
<p><b><big> The next function of "T-home" house security system. The house will be equipped with a group of security camera and sensor that will connected to the app. When you are not staying at home, you can directly view the app to supervise your house. You can be able to keep an eye on everything happening in your house. For example, you have to go somewhere and worry about your kid at home staying alone. Thanks to T-home, not only you can keep doing your work but also taking care of your children. Furthermore, T-home will be collaborating with some famous home security organizations. Signal of penetration of stranger person into the house without accepted will allow the protected object to be instantly transferred to the security service and the owner of the house.</p></b></big>
<p><b><big> The last function of this app is safety and saving energy. T-home can generate every bill in your house such as gas electricity water and internet. The app will send you a notification about your due date and it can connected to your bank card. Which mean you don't have to waste any time to pay all the bill. In addition, T-home can show you yours consumption statistic in order to make sure that you don't waste any money and save more money. The app can also prevent the unfortunate consequences such as water leaks and domestic gas which can be very dangerous. Thanks to the sensor that applied to the house connected to the app you can protect your home from unexpected things happen.</p></b></big>
<p><b><big> This app project will applied many technologies and also special smart appliance that can reprogrammed to connect to the app which mean it will cost a lot of effort and money. Not only you have to use software and hardware to install this app but also you need to have the most advanced technology to put in the appliances. For example, the security camera applied a sensor that can detect a stranger person, and then it will be reprogramed to send back notification to the security organization that has been collaborated and through the app to the owner of the smart house. This project required many skills such as coding, design the app, cybersecurity..etc. Furthermore, you need to have a lot of money to invested or many big company sponsors for this project.      </p></b></big>
<p><b><big>Overall, as I said before if this project is successful it will bring a lot of benefits. Not only it can help people's daily life at home feel more comfortable and convenient but also can ensure your safety and save your money. The elder people in your home can reduce some extra labor jobs thanks to the automated system. Maybe when this app and the appliance released to the market it will attract more big companies to sponsors. And it can be developed to be perfection. However, as I say before this app required a huge amount of cost and your skill must be professional. So I wish one day I can will master the skill enough to make this project come true .</p></b></big>
